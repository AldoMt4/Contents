 // The given C program prompts the user to enter an unsigned integer and then processes this integer through the mystery function. 
// Within the function, a mask is initialized to represent the most significant bit (MSB) of a 32-bit integer. 
// The program iterates through each bit of the input, checking if the MSB is set as the bits are left-shifted. For every time the MSB is found to be set, a counter is incremented. 
// At the end of the process, the function checks if the total count of times the MSB was set is even or odd. 
// If it is even, the program returns 1; if it is odd, it returns 0.
// Thus, the program effectively determines whether the MSB of the input integer has been set an even or odd number of times during the shifting operations.
