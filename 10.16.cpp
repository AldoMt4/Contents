// The provided C program determines if an integer entered by the user is a multiple of a specific integer X
// X. The function multiple checks the first 10 bits of the input integer
//  using bitwise operations. If any of these bits are set to 1, the function indicates that the integer is not a multiple of X X. For the function to return that the integer is a multiple, it must have none of the first 10 bits set. 
//  Thus, the value of X is 1024.
